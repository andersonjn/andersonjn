I am a faculty member for the school of business at the University of Kansas and a Ph.D. student in personal financial planning at Kansas State University. I am interested in bridging the world of personal financial planning and data science. 

I'm currently working on learning R, Python, Git, and Tableau. I already know Stata and MPlus from my doctoral training. 

You can reach me at jasonanderson@ksu.edu or jason.anderson@ku.edu.
